# KanjiEveryday

This is a twitter bot that tweets out a random kanji everyday.

# Inspiration

I made this bot to help me get familiar with Kanji symbols within the Japanese language. In addition to being familiar with the meaning of the Kanji, I decided to add examples to learn the context to see when the Kanji would be appropriate. 

# Technologies used

I used [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) to tweet out the kanji from the twitter account. 

[Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/KanjiAlive/api/learn-to-read-and-write-japanese-kanji?endpoint=55c74eb1e4b0fa5937a107c8) was used to acquire the kanji along with its meanings.

Heroku was used to deploy and Heroku scheduler was used to automate tweeting once a day.
